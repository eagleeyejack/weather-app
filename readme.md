Todo List:

The app should have two screens: (I have three at the moment, can move the search into the main page as there's space?)

a. Home screen
Display the current weather conditions

- temperature ✅
- weather description ✅
- and any other relevant information for the user's current location ✅
- handle state for not accepting permissions ✅

b. Forecast screen:
Display a 5-day weather forecast for the user's current location ✅

The app should make use of an open API to fetch weather data. You can choose any open weather API of your choice (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.). ✅

The app should handle errors gracefully. If there is an error fetching weather data or the API returns an error response, display an appropriate error message to the user. ✅

Use React Navigation or any other navigation library of your choice to implement navigation between the home and forecast screens. ✅

Implement the ability for the user to:

- search for weather conditions in different locations ✅
- save a City once you’ve searched for it (async storage, leave comments about using a DB)

Please provide a GitHub repository link containing your React Native code along with a README file explaining how to run the app and any additional information you think is necessary.

Note: You are free to use any additional libraries or tools you deem necessary to complete the task. Focus on writing clean, maintainable code, and demonstrate your proficiency in working with React Native components, state management, API integration, and navigation.
